Re “
Can Anything Be Done to Assuage Rural Rage?
,” by Paul Krugman (column, Jan. 27):
Mr. Krugman’s piece on rural resentment illustrates, in its inadvertent condescension, the very reasons rural people resent big-city elites.
Mr. Krugman details the reasons rural complaints about big government are wrong, noting, for example, that much more federal assistance and more investment funds go to many rural areas than come in through taxes. This misses the deeper issue: Human beings need to be needed, to feel that the work they do matters to the larger community.
For decades now the jobs that help men to feel they are contributing something essential, such as coal mining, manufacturing and farming, have been disappearing. We’ve created an economy that cuts off access to meaningful work, and then told people we’ll “help them” with welfare. Who wouldn’t resent that?

In my town of approximately 5,000 people, there are at least five farms. Those federal farm subsidies go mostly to corporate farms, leaving family farms the crumbs. Who helps young people who want to farm to buy farmland? Who helps farmers construct decent housing for their migrant workers? Who helps food producers convert to organic farming or to crops that pay them more?
What if the government reopened the rural hospitals that were closed and subsidized them, staffing them with nurses, nurse practitioners and midwives who know when to send their patients to doctors and when to treat them on-site?
What if it helped locals revitalize Main Street, set up food co-ops when the only supermarket leaves town, and replace the only bank when it closes?
These projects will turn rural residents’ negative opinions of “the government” around.

When my kids graduated from a rural high school in upstate New York in the mid 1980s, every classmate with decent academic skills and ambition went away to college, most never to return. They were applauded and encouraged by their teachers and the community.
Those left behind must have had some feelings of resentment. While they are proud of their children’s achievement, their children and grandchildren now live far away. The kids may have picked up more liberal social values and no longer attend church.

Thus, the resentment toward “elites” in a rural area may be less that they feel disrespected, but that the elites have taken their family away. Economic issues are secondary.

To the Editor:
As a product of rural Ohio and a current San Franciscan, I disagree with Paul Krugman’s argument about the disrespect rural Americans feel. It is not a simple manner of which side makes fun of the other.
White rural Americans have felt they have been progressively losing the culture war on the battlefield of our cultural institutions (entertainment, media, education, politics) since at least the 1960s.
These institutions have been used to change or advance views on various issues — race, gender and sexuality, political correctness, to name a few — and this has been seen as an affront to a deeply held identity rooted in faith and family traditions. This affront is where the rage comes from.

Re “
To Reduce Lead Levels in Baby Food, F.D.A. Proposes New Set of Guidelines
” (news article, Jan. 25):
While movement by the F.D.A. to reduce the amount of lead in food our youngest children eat is an important step, the proposed guidance falls short of protecting children’s health.
The science is clear that lead imperils children’s brains even at very low levels, and that other chemicals such as arsenic and mercury are also toxic, with serious consequences from early life exposures.
These chemicals are in our children’s food and contribute to intellectual and learning disabilities, autism spectrum disorder, A.D.H.D. and other neurodevelopmental disorders.
While reducing dietary exposure to lead by 25 percent for some children is progress, the simple reality is that there is no “safe” level of lead. No parents would be happy to give their child only 25 percent less of a dangerous chemical. We want to give all children the best chance in life, and that means not accepting any unnecessary risk to their brain development.
Moreover, this is a clear issue of racial and environmental justice, as the research shows that African American and other children of color and those living in poverty are more exposed to lead and can suffer greater harm.
The F.D.A. must take immediate action to drastically minimize levels of toxic chemicals and speed up the process of removing them entirely from foods our children eat.

It was a clever move for one of your letter writers to ask ChatGPT to write a letter responding to a Jan. 15 guest essay, “
How ChatGPT Hijacks Democracy
,” which discussed the dangers that A.I. might bring to lobbying.
I fed that letter, “
ChatGPT Wrote (Most of) This Letter
” (Jan. 25), into ChatGPT and asked it to write a rebuttal, in the form of another letter to the editor. It dutifully did so — both an initial polite version and then a more strident one when I asked it to “make it stronger.”
Bot-wise, I’d call it a tie score. When I noted that it was arguing against something that it had written, it responded politely, “I can write on any topic.” And “I don’t have personal beliefs or opinions.”
Forget lobbying. This is a politician.

To the Editor:
Every state should take in legal migrants, rather than our placing the responsibility primarily on the southern border states. We are a country built on and made strong by immigrants.
We have a mere 
3.4 percent unemployment rate
 and a major infrastructure-rebuilding effort. The immigrants want to work, and we need workers.
Legal immigrants should be interviewed and sent to all states based on their needs and size, with accommodations, services and jobs 
planned
 to address the needs of the immigrants and the states alike.
Stop complaining, and start strategizing and acting to help all of us make our entire country stronger with these immigrants’ help.

Re “
The Crypto Collapse and the End of Magical Thinking
,” by Mihir A. Desai (Opinion guest essay, Jan. 18):
The young have time to play with get-rich-quick “investments.” They have the time to learn. Those that do not will never.
At 82, I am a follower of the economist and investor Benjamin Graham and have been for 25 years. This policy has served me well. Purchase stock in well-run companies, and sit tight. Recessions will come, then go, and one’s investments will ride the storms.
There is no better way.
