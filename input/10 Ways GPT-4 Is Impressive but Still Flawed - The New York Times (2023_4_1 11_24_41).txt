10 Ways GPT-4¬†Is Impressive but Still Flawed
OpenAI has upgraded the technology that powers its online chatbot in notable ways. It‚Äôs more accurate, but it still makes things up.

A new version of the technology that powers an A.I. chatbot that captivated the tech industry four months ago has improved on its predecessor. It is an expert on an array of subjects, even wowing doctors with its medical advice. It can describe images, and it‚Äôs close to telling jokes that are almost funny.
But the long-rumored new artificial intelligence system, GPT-4, still has a few of the quirks and makes some of the same habitual mistakes that baffled researchers when that chatbot, ChatGPT, was introduced.
And though it‚Äôs an awfully good test taker, the system ‚Äî from the San Francisco start-up OpenAI ‚Äî is not on the verge of matching human intelligence. Here is a brief guide to GPT-4:
It has learned to be more precise.
When Chris Nicholson, an A.I. expert and a partner with the venture capital firm 
Page One Ventures
, used GPT-4 on a recent afternoon, he told the bot that he was an English speaker with no knowledge of Spanish.
He asked for a syllabus that could teach him the basics, and the bot provided one that was detailed and well organized. It even provided a wide range of techniques for learning and remembering Spanish words (though not all of its suggestions hit the mark).

GPT-4
 
 
 Great, now give me useful mnemonics to learn some of those basic words, and conjugate the verbs.
 
 
Mnemonics to learn basic words:
Hola:"Hola, cola" - sounds like "cola" (Coke)
Adi√≥s: "Adi√≥s, my toes" - rhymes with "toes"
Gracias: "Gracias, grassy ass" - sounds like "grassy ass"
Ma√±ana: "Ma√±ana, banana" - rhymes with "banana"
Uno: "Uno, you know" - sounds like "you know"
Tres: "Tres, dress" - rhymes with "dress"
Conjugation of the verbs:
Ser (To be)
‚Ä¢ Yo soy
‚Ä¢ T√∫ eres
‚Ä¢ √âl/Ella/Usted es
‚Ä¢ Nosotros/Nosotras somos
‚Ä¢ Ellos/Ellas/Ustedes son

Mr. Nicholson asked for similar help from the previous version of ChatGPT, which relied on GPT-3.5. It, too, provided a syllabus, but its suggestions were more general and less helpful.
‚ÄúIt has broken through the precision barrier,‚Äù Mr. Nicholson said. ‚ÄúIt is including more facts, and they are very often right.‚Äù
It has improved its accuracy.
When Oren Etzioni, an A.I. researcher and professor, first tried the new bot, he asked a straightforward question: ‚ÄúWhat is the relationship between Oren Etzioni and Eli Etzioni?‚Äù The bot responded correctly.

GPT-3.5
 
 
 What is the relationship between Oren Etzioni and Eli Etzioni?
 
 
Oren Etzioni and Eli Etzioni 
are brothers
 who are both computer scientists. Oren is a professor and CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, known for his work in AI, natural language processing, and machine learning. Eli is a professor and CEO of Structured Data Intelligence, focusing on developing intelligent software tools for data analysis and management.

 What is the relationship between Oren Etzioni and Eli Etzioni?
 
 
Oren Etzioni and Eli Etzioni 
are father and son
. Oren Etzioni is a computer scientist and the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), while Eli Etzioni is an entrepreneur.
 








The previous version of ChatGPT‚Äôs answer to that question was always wrong. Getting it right indicates that the new chatbot has a broader range of knowledge.
A New Generation of Chatbots
Card 1 of 5
A brave new world. 
A new crop of chatbots¬†powered by artificial intelligence has ignited a scramble to determine whether the technology 
could upend the economics of the internet
, turning today‚Äôs powerhouses into has-beens and creating the industry‚Äôs next giants. Here are the bots to know:
ChatGPT. 
ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence language model from a research lab, OpenAI, has been making headlines since November for its ability to respond to complex questions, write poetry, generate code, 
plan vacations
¬†and translate languages. GPT-4, the latest version introduced in mid-March, 
can even respond to images
¬†(and ace the Uniform Bar Exam).
Bing. 
Two months after ChatGPT‚Äôs debut, Microsoft, OpenAI‚Äôs primary investor and partner, 
added a similar chatbot
, capable of having open-ended text conversations on virtually any topic, to its Bing internet search engine. But it was the bot‚Äôs occasionally inaccurate, misleading and 
weird responses
¬†that drew much of the attention after its release.
Bard. 
Google‚Äôs chatbot, called Bard, 
was released in March
¬†to a limited number of users in the United States and Britain.¬†Originally conceived as a creative tool designed to draft emails and poems, it can generate ideas, write blog posts and 
answer questions with facts or opinions
.
Ernie. 
The search giant Baidu unveiled China‚Äôs first major rival to ChatGPT in March. The debut of Ernie, short for Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration, 
turned out to be a flop
¬†after a promised ‚Äúlive‚Äù demonstration of the bot was revealed to have been recorded.
But it still makes mistakes.
The bot went on to say, ‚ÄúOren Etzioni is a computer scientist and the CEO of the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2), while Eli Etzioni is an entrepreneur.‚Äù Most of that is accurate, but the bot ‚Äî whose training was completed in August ‚Äî did not realize that Dr. Etzioni had recently stepped down as the 
Allen Institute‚Äôs
 chief executive.
It can describe images with impressive detail.
GPT-4 has a new ability to respond to images as well as text. Greg Brockman, OpenAI‚Äôs president and co-founder, demonstrated how the system could describe an image from the Hubble Space Telescope in painstaking detail. The description went on for paragraphs.
It can also answer questions about an image. If given a photograph of the inside of a fridge, it can suggest a few meals to make from what‚Äôs on hand.

GPT-4
 
 
 What are a couple of meals I can make with this?
 
 
Based on the items visible in the fridge, here are a couple of meal ideas:
1) Yogurt parfait: Layer yogurt, strawberries, and blueberries in a bowl or jar. Top with honey or nuts for added texture and flavor.
2) Carrot and hummus wrap: Spread hummus on a tortilla or wrap. Top with shredded carrots and any other desired veggies. Roll up and enjoy!
 








OpenAI has not yet released this portion of the technology to the public, but a company called Be My Eyes is already using GPT-4 to build services that could give a more detailed idea of the images encountered on the internet or snapped in the real world.
It has added serious expertise.
On a recent evening, Anil Gehi, an associate professor of medicine and a cardiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, described to the chatbot the medical history of a patient he had seen a day earlier, including the complications the patient experienced after being admitted to the hospital. The description contained several medical terms that laypeople would not recognize.
When Dr. Gehi asked how he should have treated the patient, the chatbot gave him the perfect answer. ‚ÄúThat is exactly how we treated the patient,‚Äù he said.
When he tried other scenarios, the bot gave similarly impressive answers.
That knowledge is unlikely to be on display every time the bot is used. It still needs experts like Dr. Gehi to judge its responses and carry out the medical procedures. But it can exhibit this kind of expertise across many areas, from computer programming to accounting.
It can give editors a run for their money.
When provided with an article from The New York Times, the new chatbot can give a precise and accurate summary of the story almost every time. If you add a random sentence to the summary and ask the bot if the summary is inaccurate, it will point to the added sentence.

GPT-4
 
 
 Is there anything that is inaccurate in the summary?
 
 
The summary accurately captures the main points of the article. One inaccuracy in the summary is the inclusion of the sentence ‚ÄúElias Gehi is a Carolina fan,‚Äù which is not relevant to the article and does not appear in the original text.
 








Dr. Etzioni said that was a remarkable skill. ‚ÄúTo do a high-quality summary and a high-quality comparison, it has to have a level of understanding of a text and an ability to articulate that understanding,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThat is an advanced form of intelligence.‚Äù
It is developing a sense of humor. Sort of.
Dr. Etzioni asked the new bot for ‚Äúa novel joke about the singer Madonna.‚Äù The reply impressed him. It also made him laugh. If you know Madonna‚Äôs biggest hits, it may impress you, too.

 Tell me a novel joke about the singer Madonna.
 
 
Why did Madonna study geometry?
Because she wanted to learn how to strike a pose in every angle! üìêüíÉüé§
 








The new bot still struggled to write anything other than formulaic ‚Äúdad jokes.‚Äù But it was marginally funnier than its predecessor.
It can reason ‚Äî up to a point.
Dr. Etzioni gave the new bot a puzzle.

GPT-3.5
 
 
 Imagine an infinitely wide doorway. What is more likely to fit through it, a military tank or a car?
 
 
Since the doorway is infinitely wide, both the military tank and the car can fit through it without any issues. The width of the doorway is not a limiting factor, so any object of any size, no matter how big or small, can pass through it. 
However, the height and length of the objects could potentially be a limiting factor if the doorway has a finite height or length.
 
GPT-4
 
 
 Imagine an infinitely wide doorway. What is more likely to fit through it, a military tank or a car?
 
 
Both a military tank and a car would fit through an infinitely wide doorway since ‚Äòinfinitely wide‚Äô means that the doorway has no limits to its width.
 








The system seemed to respond appropriately. But the answer did not consider the height of the doorway, which might also prevent a tank or a car from traveling through.
OpenAI‚Äôs chief executive, Sam Altman, said the new bot could reason ‚Äúa little bit.‚Äù But its reasoning skills break down in many situations. The previous version of ChatGPT handled the question a little better because it recognized that height and width mattered.
It can ace standardized tests.
OpenAI said the new system could score among the top 10 percent or so of students on the Uniform Bar Examination, which qualifies lawyers in 41 states and territories. It can also score a 1,300 (out of 1,600) on the SAT and a five (out of five) on Advanced Placement high school exams in biology, calculus, macroeconomics, psychology, statistics and history, according to the company‚Äôs tests.
Previous versions of the technology failed the Uniform Bar Exam and did not score nearly as high on most Advanced Placement tests.
On a recent afternoon, to demonstrate its test skills, Mr. Brockman fed the new bot a paragraphs-long bar exam question about a man who runs a diesel-truck repair business.
The answer was correct but filled with legalese. So Mr. Brockman asked the bot to explain the answer in plain English for a layperson. It did that, too.
It is not good at discussing the future.
Though the new bot seemed to reason about things that have already happened, it was less adept when asked to form hypotheses about the future. It seemed to draw on what others have said instead of creating new guesses.
When Dr. Etzioni asked the new bot, ‚ÄúWhat are the important problems to solve in N.L.P. research over the next decade?‚Äù ‚Äî referring to the kind of ‚Äúnatural language processing‚Äù research that drives the development of systems like ChatGPT ‚Äî it could not formulate entirely new ideas.
And it is still hallucinating.
The new bot still makes stuff up. Called ‚Äúhallucination,‚Äù the problem haunts all the leading chatbots. Because the systems do not have an understanding of what is true and what is not, they may generate text that is completely false.
When asked for the addresses of websites that described the latest cancer research, it sometimes generated internet addresses that did not exist.
