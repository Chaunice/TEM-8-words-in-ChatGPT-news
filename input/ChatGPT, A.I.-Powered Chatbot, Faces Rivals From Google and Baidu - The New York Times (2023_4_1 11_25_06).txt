Everybody’s got a bot 
Just over two months ago, OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public, instantly thrusting the A.I.-powered chatbot into the center of mainstream discourse, with debates about how it could transform business, education and more. (It also spurred Microsoft 
to invest $10 billion
 in OpenAI.)
Now Google and the Chinese tech giant Baidu have unveiled their own chatbots, hoping to convince the world their efforts in so-called generative A.I. — tech that can spout off conversational text, make images and more — are just as ready for prime time.
Meet Bard, Google’s forthcoming chatbot.
 
The service
, which will be privately tested before being released more broadly soon, is based on technology that the company has been testing for months. It’s Google’s latest response to ChatGPT, whose success spurred the tech giant to declare a “code red” and rush out its own A.I.-powered offerings.
Google’s C.E.O., Sundar Pichai, made clear to employees in an internal memo, reviewed by CNBC, that 
Bard is now a top priority
. “Next week, we’ll be enlisting every Googler to help shape Bard and contribute through a special company-wide dogfood,” he wrote, referring to tech jargon for testing out a product internally.
And meet Ernie, Baidu’s own offering.
 Short for “Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration,” 
the chatbot
 is built on tech that Baidu said it has been working on since 2019. The Chinese tech company said that Ernie’s underlying generative A.I. incorporates huge swaths of data, which should make it more useful. Shares in Baidu jumped over 13 percent on the news, to their highest level in nearly a year.
Other companies aren’t standing still.
 Microsoft is expected to unveil something on Tuesday related to ChatGPT, with OpenAI’s chief, Sam Altman, 
in attendance
. And Meta, Facebook’s parent company, is figuring out 
how to remind the world
 of its own prowess in generative A.I., despite widespread criticism of products it had previously released. (Meanwhile, there are still 
reminders
 that generative A.I. 
isn’t perfect
.)
DealBook asked ChatGPT itself whether OpenAI should be worried about the growing competition. Its answer:
No, I am a language model without personal thoughts or emotions. My goal is to provide accurate and helpful responses.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING 
The F.T.C. won’t keep fighting a Meta deal in federal court.
 The agency said it 
wouldn’t try to overturn
 a judge’s rejection of its case that Meta was eradicating potential future competition by taking over a virtual-reality start-up. The ruling was a blow to the F.T.C.’s Big Tech crackdown — but the agency said the judge had not dismissed the reasoning behind its lawsuit, which it could still test in other cases.
SoftBank loses nearly $6 billion from investments.
 The Japanese tech conglomerate reported a 
$5.9 billion quarterly loss
, driven by continued red ink at its Vision Funds and other investment funds. It was SoftBank’s first financial presentation not presided over by its founder, Masa Son.

Adani Group rebounds as it pays off some debt.
 Shares in the Indian conglomerate’s flagship firm, Adani Enterprises, surged 15 percent after the company agreed to 
prepay $1.1 billion in loans
. Still, the group has lost $115 billion in market value since an American short seller accused it of accounting fraud and stock manipulation.

A meme-stock bailout 
The ailing retailer Bed Bath & Beyond is hoping to ride the meme-stock wave to secure the rescue financing it needs to avoid bankruptcy. Rather than venture into the pricey corporate debt market, the company is planning to issue 
about $1 billion worth of stock
 that it will use to pay down debt and fund its business.
Shares of Bed Bath nearly are
 
up nearly 250 percent
 since it warned of a possible bankruptcy filing 
early last month
. That rally is
 
probably driven by retail investors looking to squeeze short sellers. Existing investors — who will be diluted by the flood of 
900 million new shares
 — were less excited by the news: the retailer’s shares were down more than 20 percent in the after market.
Meme-stock darlings have tried this move before. 
AMC, the movie-theater chain that has faced its own liquidity challenges recently, offered preferred shares 
in August
. (Both sets of AMC shares 
have remained volatile
.) In 2020, Hertz tried to sell shares 
after
 filing for bankruptcy, but the S.E.C. 
squashed those efforts.
As last-ditch moves go, it’s not a bad one. 
Existing shareholders may prefer being diluted to a bankruptcy that wipes them out entirely. “If suddenly a golden goose has appeared on your doorstep and starts laying golden eggs — and you decide, well, I just don’t believe in golden geese, and I’m just going to ignore these geese and eggs on my doorstep — I’m not sure that’s the right call,” said Eric Talley, a professor of finance at Columbia Law School.
Who is putting up the money? 
Bed Bath & Beyond already has commitments for its offerings, though it is unclear who
 
from. (There has been interest in the company: DealBook has reported that the private equity firm Sycamore 
has looked
 at buying parts of Bed Bath & Beyond, including Buy Buy Baby, as part of a possible bankruptcy deal.)
There are still risks.
 
Many of Bed Bath & Beyond’s 
fundamental challenges remain
, and an equity deal is unlike a leveraged buyout in one key way: If the company does go bankrupt, even preferred equity investors will be behind debt holders in the line to be paid back. But with investment firms 
eager to put money to work,
 and the leveraged loan market frozen, it may be the last best option.
Business braces for Biden’s big speech
President Biden will deliver his State of the Union address in a more hostile setting on Tuesday: the Republican-controlled House. For businesses, the political divisions could mean
 
more uncertainty during turbulent times.
Here’s what Biden is expected to say, and what businesses and economists will be listening for:
Tax: 
Biden 
is expected
 to call for a quadrupling of the tax paid on share buybacks, and push for new levies on high-income earners and businesses, all in an effort to reduce the deficit.
Competition:
 Antitrust will be a 
focus of the speech
. Cracking down on Big Tech is an area of bipartisan unity, but that doesn’t mean the parties will work together on it. Before tonight’s speech, the trade association TechNet, which includes Google, Apple and Meta, said it would like to see the president avoid “advocating for arbitrary legislation that would target America’s most successful companies.”
Debt: 
With a June default by the U.S. looming, Biden is expected to double down on raising the debt limit. He has been 
talking to Speaker Kevin McCarthy
, but apparently won’t discuss suggested spending cuts — a position that Americans seem to favor, 
polls show
. The president should be “willing to sit down and negotiate,” Suzanne Clark, C.E.O. of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote in a blog post, adding that “default is not an option.”
Geopolitics: 
With the spy balloon controversy lingering,
 
the president will want to send a tough-on-China message — 
without alienating Beijing
. Businesses and investors increasingly see China exposure as a potential risk; the balloon saga even added a bit of 
market volatility
 earlier in the week.

Trade like a lawmaker 
On Tuesday, Subversive Capital Advisor 
announced
 that it has teamed up with Unusual Whales, the market data provider that has been monitoring trades connected to members of the U.S. Congress, to produce two new E.T.F.s that claim to track lawmakers’ stock holdings.
The tickers: KRUZ for Republicans, NANC for Democrats. (We wonder 
whom
 they’re 
referring to
.)
Here’s how the top stock holdings in each E.T.F. have fared:
