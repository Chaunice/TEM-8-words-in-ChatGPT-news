Baidu plans to roll out its ChatGPT-style technology next month.

China’s stuttering A.I. ambitions 
The hottest story in technology right now is the rise of ChatGPT, and the race among tech giants like Microsoft and Google to offer A.I.-powered services of their own. But the A.I. arms race isn’t confined to the U.S.; other countries are also rushing to show they’re big players.
Nowhere is that more apparent than in China, a self-professed leader in A.I., as some of its top companies proclaim their advances in ChatGPT-style tech. But they also face a big hurdle: their own government.
Baidu is taking the lead in showing off its chatbot chops.
 The Chinese internet giant said yesterday that it 
plans to roll out Ernie
, its rival to ChatGPT, next month, embedding it in a version of its search engine, much as Microsoft has incorporated ChatGPT into an experimental version of Bing. Baidu’s C.E.O., Robin Li, boasted that Ernie was trained with over 100 billion parameters, or data points, and was built with a focus on serving Chinese customers.
Baidu 
isn’t the only Chinese tech company talking up its A.I. efforts
: Tencent, Alibaba, NetEase and JD.com have all said they’re working on ChatGPT-style offerings, though without specifying concrete timetables. And others, like the food-delivery app Meituan, plan to invest millions in the technology (though Meituan’s co-founder acknowledged he knows little about A.I.). CNBC has a 
handy rundown
 of what Chinese tech companies have said publicly about their ambitions in generative A.I., the technology that drives ChatGPT.
But Beijing is also hitting the brakes.
 Regulators are said to have told Tencent and Ant Group, the fintech affiliate of Alibaba, 
not to allow ChatGPT
 on their platforms, according to Nikkei Asia. (ChatGPT isn’t officially available in China, but Tencent has already blocked third-party services that claim to offer access.) Other companies will need to notify the government before offering chatbot services, Nikkei added.
Behind Beijing’s reluctance is a worry that chatbots might escape government-imposed boundaries, particularly censorship. (Consider how unpredictable answers by ChatGPT and Bing have been.) All of this underscores wider concerns confronting China’s tech sector, The Times’s Li Yuan wrote last week: Are Beijing’s growing 
control of the private sector
 and geopolitical tensions putting the country’s once-promising position in A.I. at risk?
In other A.I. news:
JPMorgan Chase is at least temporarily 
restricting how traders can use ChatGPT
.
Microsoft is 
removing limits
 it had placed just days ago on conversations with its Bing chatbot — because users didn’t like them.
Searches on Google’s chatbot, Bard, probably 
cost 10 times as much
 as standard queries, according to John Hennessy, Alphabet’s chair. (He told Reuters that those costs should fall quickly.)

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING 
The Justice Department reportedly revives an antitrust inquiry into Google Maps. 
Prosecutors are examining how Alphabet 
bundles its search and mapping products
 for potential violations of competition law, according to Bloomberg. The government has brought two other lawsuits against Alphabet in recent years.
Top Fed officials worry more must be done to fight inflation.
 
Minutes from a meeting
 of the central bank’s Federal Open Markets Committee early this month show that governors believed that interest rates needed to be raised more, with some advocating a restrictive monetary policy. The Fed went on to raise rates by 25 basis points; it’s largely expected to maintain that pace.

A chip giant grapples with doubts about a big U.S. move
Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world’s dominant chip maker, drew support from the likes of President Biden and Tim Cook of Apple in December, when it said it planned to invest $40 billion to overhaul and expand a manufacturing hub in Arizona.
But as The Times’s John Liu and Paul Mozur report, the move isn’t 
universally loved within TSMC
:
Internal doubts are mounting at the Taiwanese chip maker over its U.S. factory, according to interviews with 11 TSMC employees, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Many of the workers said the project could distract from the research and development focus that had long helped TSMC outmaneuver rivals. Some added that they were hesitant to move to the United States because of potential culture clashes. 
Investors grill Gensler over his plan to shake up markets 
The S.E.C.’s plan to overhaul the way markets operate is drawing heat from some of the retail investors that the agency says it is meant to help. The agency’s chair, Gary Gensler, heard from members of the advocacy group We The Investors in an 
online discussion
 yesterday that the proposal goes too far in some areas and not far enough in others.
Much ado about auctions. 
The plan would force most retail trades to go through auctions on open exchanges, rather than being routed through a few market makers who pay brokers for these orders — a practice known as “payment for order flow.”
But the auction rule is complex and untested, and even some of its supporters are dubious. “Why not a simpler rule?” asked David Lauer, the C.E.O. of Urvin Finance, a social media and market information platform for retail investors. Mr. Gensler suggested that the big industry players were also unhappy about this aspect of the proposal, and changes could be coming.
Industry resistance is in full swing. 
The proposals “represent fundamental changes” not backed by enough analysis, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association wrote in a recent 
letter to the S.E.C.
 It wants the comment period extended and access to the data the agency relied on for its economic analyses. Similarly, Nasdaq’s C.E.O., Adena Friedman, expressed doubts in a meeting with an S.E.C. commissioner, Mark Uyeda, and suggested that 
more consultation time may be needed
.
But the
 
critics want different things
 and the S.E.C. isn’t going to please everyone. Exchanges and market makers say that the proposed limits on payment for order flow and exchange rebates will hinder markets.
One investor, called Jay, told Mr. Gensler that the practices should have been banned and that retail traders are frustrated. “You gotta hear the people,” he said.
“You’re our clients,” the regulator responded.
“We were supposed to be the most empowered workplace in the world. Why did people not feel like they could actually raise a complaint?”

Betting on Ninja’s star power 
As the e-sports industry tries to figure out how to regain growth, one company in the field, GameSquare, is leaning into the power of influencers: It is 
hiring the gaming celebrity Tyler Blevins
, known as Ninja, as its chief innovation officer.
It’s hard to overstate Ninja’s star power in the gaming world.
 Having 
shot to fame
 via his skills playing Fortnite — and his commentary while playing — he has amassed over 17 million followers on Twitch. (He has also said he earns about $500,000 a month from streaming.)
Ninja is tasked with developing growth opportunities at GameSquare
, which runs businesses including an e-sports team and a talent agency, in part by helping launch Ninja Labs, an in-house incubator. (His compensation will include a salary, equity and revenue-sharing in the intellectual property he develops at GameSquare.)
Justin Kenna, GameSquare’s C.E.O., told DealBook that the job would give Ninja a new way to make money outside gaming, as athletes do in sports like basketball and football. “The reality is that he’s a media asset in his own right,” Mr. Kenna said. “So how do we create opportunities for him to monetize into the future outside of just streaming?”
The hiring comes as GameSquare, and its industry, are re-finding their footing.
 Though e-sports has broken through to mainstream culture, that 
hasn’t exactly led to huge profits
.
GameSquare itself, which went public in 2020 and counts the Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones as a major shareholder, has seen its stock fall about 70 percent since then. The company is now 
combining with Engine Media
 to expand its offerings to gaming, advertising and merchandising.
The goal, according to Tom Rogers, the executive chairman of Engine Media, is to grab the eyeballs of Gen Z customers as they shift away from traditional media and platforms that rely on standard ad-based business models. “It’s not that Gen Z is spending less time with media,” he told DealBook. “It’s they’re spending less time with media than where advertisers have traditionally found them.”
