## Process

- The official website of The New York Times was used to retrieve 191 articles about ChatGPT from January 1st to April 1st of this year. 

- The corpus was then cleaned with [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy), which revealed a surplus of advanced vocabulary items. To mitigate this, an initial screening was performed using Magoosh's GRE wordlist. 
- Subsequently, the final screening was conducted using the [word list for TEM-8](https://github.com/mahavivo/english-wordlists), based on the previous table. The resulting wordlist consisted of 328 words and included their phonetic symbols and Chinese translations.
